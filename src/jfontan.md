* **Path**: /Spain/Madrid

I'm an energetic geek that likes to tinker with technology. Since young I found that I liked graphics programming but as time went by I moved to systems. One of the things I like the most is making tools to automate or manage things, as you will find in the experience section.


## Experience

**2010-NOW - Founder/Engineer, OpenNebula Systems, Madrid, Spain**

I am one of the founders of the OpenNebula Systems Company. This company develops and gives commercial support for OpenNebula Open Source project. This is a small company and I have a wide spectrum of roles:

* Software development:
  * Command line interface
  * General driver development (the part of the software that glues the main daemon with the underlying technology)
  * Ruby API
  * Virtual Machine drivers (KVM, Xen and vCenter)
  * Storage drivers (plain files, qcow2, gluster and lvm)
* Software packaging:
  * Description files for each distribution packages
  * Ruby gems installation scripts
* Testing infrastructure:
  * Jenkins jobs configuration
  * Glue scripts to spin up micro environments where to run tests
  * Ansible playbooks to configure the micro environments
* Installation of OpenNebula in customer's infraestructure
* Provide support in the customer's ticketing systems
* Give tutorials and speeches to customers or the community
* Community engaging

**2007-2013 - Distributed Systems Researcher, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain**

My role there started as developer of a grid computing tool (GridWay) and System Administrator of the Distributed Systems Architecture group clusters.

Early in my stay, we also started researching and developing OpenNebula, a Virtual Machine manager (initially KVM and Xen) that enables people to create IaaS type clouds. I'm one of the three developers that created this software (http://opennebula.org). Some of the tasks done for this project were:

* Development of the ruby library used to communicate external components with the main daemon
* Creating the build system for the project using scons build tool
* Base driver engine that spawns remote actions when needed
* Transfer manager, clone, link, delete VM images
* VM manager, manage VMs in KVM and Xen

**2004-2006 - Grid Technician, CESGA, Santiago de Compostela, Spain**

Contracted by a European Funded research project called EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-science) I assumed the role of Systems Administrator of our grid machines. I deployed and maintained grid infrastructure in our site and also global monitoring and web collaboration tools.

**2001-2004 - Systems Technician, CESGA, Santiago de Compostela, Spain**

My roles at CESGA (Galicia Supercomputing Center) were maintaining UNIX clusters destined to Scientific research and helping the rest of the technical staff with Linux and programming matters. During my stay there I supervised the rendering of a CGI film, started a protein visualization program using OpenGL, optimizing of applications for speed, Systems Administration and R&D in Grid technologies. I also took part in a european funded grid project called CrossGrid where we worked on making interactive and parallel programs run in grid environment where I assisted and participated in various conferences and work meetings.


## Education

**1999-2001 - Systems Administration, Vocational Education, IES Chan do Monte, Spain**

I studied Systems Administration in a Technical School but most of my technical knowledge was self-taught.

**1989-1999**

Started programming Basic in a Spectrum at the age of 9 and later in Pascal and x86 Assembly programming at the age of 14.


## Skills

* Programming:
  * Ruby
  * C/C++
  * Shell Scripting
* System Administration level in Linux
* Ansible
* Languages:
  * Galician - Native
  * Spanish - Native
  * English - Fluent
  * Portuguese - can read and understand it


## Projects

* [Cangallo](https://github.com/jfontan/cangallo). A tool to create and manage Virtual Machine images in qcow2 format. It also allows you to create a repository similar to docker where an image is composed of deltas.

* Server code for [glslsandbox](http://glslsandbox.com/). A shading language editor and gallery.


## Hobbies

* I am now learning go and crystal as I want to go back to lower level systems programming. These last years I've been mainly using ruby and shell script glue code.

* From 1995 to 2005 I've been into the [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) as programmer and musician. I did a lot of graphics programming but the part that I liked the most was programming low level: at first doing libraries to interact with the peripherals like graphics or sound cards and later doing asm optimization.
